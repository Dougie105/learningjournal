From what I gathered, It doesnt matter what text editer that you use as long as you enjoy using it and are comfortable with its layout and features given.

## What features should you look for in a text editor? 

### I would say some of the most important features are: 

1.) code completion; 
2.) syntax highlighting; 
3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 
4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.What features should you look for in a text editor?
