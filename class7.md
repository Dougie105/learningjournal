#Programming

* Youre giving a recipe to a computer in a language it understands and it will give you the end result you want.

* Need to be clear and percise

## Teach the robot how to put on a jacket

* ***Spoiler Alert!*** Its not easy

*Have to have more detail than a Stephen King novel.

## Javascript makes things interactive by...

1. Selecting any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
    1. Change all those attributes to whatever you specify.

2. Modify content by changing the size of images or make to to change a css rule if an action is made.

3. Button clicked
    * cursor hover
    * info is added to a form
    * set time has passed
    * a page has finished loading.

## Examples of JS

* Slideshows
* Forms
* Reload Part of a Page
* Data Filtering

## Scripts

* Can allow the browser to check the current situation and only perform a set of steps if that action is appropriate.

1. What is your goal?

2. Design your script.

    2. Write down the individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete the task.

3. Code each step of the script into JS.

# Design your script before writing it, it will be less of a headache.

* make a flowchart if that is more helpful

## Expressions that...

1. assign a value to a variable

    * var color = 'beige';

2. use two or more values to return a single value.

    * var area = 3 * 2; value would be 6 obviously.

## Arithmetic and String Operators

1. Arithmetic Operator

* +, -, /, *, ++(adds one to current number), --(subtracts one from a number), %(divides two and returns only the remainder.)

* Follows the PEMDAS principle

2. String Operator

* Just the + sign... It connects two or more strings and creates a single value.

    * Example  
    var firstName = 'Terrell';
    var lastName = 'Douglas';
    var fullName = firstName + lastName;

    output: Terrell Douglas
