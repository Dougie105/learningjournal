From what I gathered, It doesnt matter what text editer that you use as long as you enjoy using it and are comfortable with its layout and features given.

## What features should you look for in a text editor? 

### I would say some of the most important features are: 

1.) code completion; 

2.) syntax highlighting;

3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue);
 
4.) and the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

## There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
