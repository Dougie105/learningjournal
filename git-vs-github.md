# git + GitHub

* With Git (version control) and GitHub (online code storage), you can

    * Have teams working on the same code without messing others up.

# Cloning

* By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project. *
