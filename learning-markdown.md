# Learning Markdown

## Here is what I learned today.

### no. of Hashtags equil heading size. i.e. h2 = ##

*italic text*
**bold text**

*Also lists are intresting due to the fact that it is the italicization without an ending
  *space and tab for another section.
    *and you can obviously keep going.
  *This is an unordered list.
  
1.Lists can also be numbered using the number one.
2.Pretty self explanatory.
  2a. Just testing this out
    2aa. To see what happens.
