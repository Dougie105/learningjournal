# Learning Markdown

## Here is what I learned today.

### no. of Hashtags equil heading size. i.e. h2 = ##

*italic text*
**bold text**

*Also lists are intresting due to the fact that it is the italicization without an ending
  *space and tab for another section.
    *and you can obviously keep going.
  *This is an unordered list.
  
<ol>
 <li>Lists can also be numbered using the number one.</li>
 <li>Pretty self explanatory.</li>
 <li>Just testing this out</li>
 <li> To see what happens.</li>
</ol>
